    <br>
    <p>
      Since the 1990’s, the most recent version of the metro card has been easily susceptible to being bent, lost, and almost impossible to scan correctly the first time. In addition to the detrimental alterations that can be made physically to the MetroCard, there is also the virtual component. When users are unsure of whether they have enough money on their metro card for a full fair or not, they can either swipe their card at the fare box or at the turnstile. If the user verifies that the current amount of money on their metro card is not enough, they must then turn to another machine to increase the value on their metro card, which takes fixed amounts of money. More specifically there are multiple machines made for the user to add value to their MetroCard, some accept bills and the others accept a credit or debit card. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Our overall objective is eliminating the time it takes to purchase an MTA MetroCard. The problem we are solving is the user missing his or her train due to being on a time crunch. Our app, Transit Mobile, allows the user to spend extra time wrapping up a presentation for work, notes for a test, or errands around the house, without worrying about missing the train due to complications derived from the MetroCard. Our application of a virtual MetroCard will allow the user to push the margins of getting from one destination to another, as well as fluid navigation amongst tight deadlines.

    After testing the prototype, we noticed some key insights were shared amongst all users. Each user prioritized features in the app which gave them the fastest results. From the request to optimize time spent navigating throughout the product, we added a fastest route icon, that once selected would bring up the closest train station with the shortest travel time. Most of the users also felt that the icons responsible for searching for a destination and picking the fastest route could be combined. After analyzing the possibility of combing the functionality of both icons, and choosing one icon to represent them both, we opted for the combination. Users also felt that the choice of icon symbols was a bit confusing. Most of the confusion came from the icon that represented the users account, and the settings icon. After further debate we decided on changing the original settings icon, depicted as three circles, to a bell. Until further research is done the account info icon will continue to be displayed as a humanoid symbol. Lastly our users wanted to see fewer words in the account section of the app. They mainly discussed using the account info for adding value, and that if they did experience any problems, they would prefer to be directed to another section.

   Wasn't sure why the app had to have access to his location. Would have preferred to have the ad value button toward the bottom of the account info page. 
   “I usually expect to see settings under the actual settings section of my phone, not an app.” Expressed confusion in the functionality of the route icon and search icon and how they worked off each other. “If I did not search a destination and just clicked the route tab, what would come up? Pointed out 
   that if the routes tab took him to the nearest train stop, that would be useful. Likes the idea of a finger print sign in button, doesn’t like the idea of having to enter in information every time he signs in. Thought that the humanoid icon is confusing and suggested having a money icon instead. Also suggested having a bell icon instead of three circle settings symbol.

  When looking over the route tab, user stated that he would prefer to select the fastest route naturally. “I would prefer to be taken directly to the fastest route, with the route details provided.” Stated he would only prefer to go through multiple options of different routes if it was not possible to take the first one. Suggested to incorporate a back button from the fastest route tab. Would prefer for there to be a scrolling feature when fastest route details pops up, to scroll from the route details to a map, all on one page.."So I can get to where I need to be as fast as possible.” Suggested to add an auto refill in the add value section.  
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>User 3
  <br>
  <br>
   Was confused over the navigational component of the app. “Does it give you navigation in terms of which way to walk or which way to go?” Also asked, “Does it keep track of the places you’ve been?” Expressed concern in the security features of the app, “Is there a pin or some sort of ID to put in?” Did not feel the account information provided clarity on when the MetroCard balance was low. “Do you get notified when your MetroCard value is low?” Suggested giving more information regarding the value of a user’s MetroCard. Felt that the layout needs to be cleaned up. Also Expressed confusion in the humanoid icon, felt that it doesn’t make sense. Felt that all the information presented in the humanoid icon can go into a different section, “I think the only thing that needs to go on that page are transactions and currency.”
